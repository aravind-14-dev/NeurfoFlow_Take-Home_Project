## Theory Questions Solution :

## 1.Given the information you have and any light research youâ€™d like to do on the topic, what insights can you draw?
-	GAD(General Anxiety Disorder)-7 assessment is a part of Measurement based care(MBC), a procedure that emphasizes the use of standardized assessments, and other tests to help personalize care and guide treatment decisions.

-	It is taken prior to session, at the close of session or at home prior to session. 

-	Neuroflow helps the patients to take the self-administered assessment remotely and caregivers can monitor the patient's progress and adjust treatment plans.

-	The treatment plans and tasks are delivered to the patients either through Neuroflow's website or through the app.

-	There are some patients who have taken the assessment multiple times a day which I think the patients couldn't give the assessment properly in their first or multiple attempts until they are satisfied.

## 2. What assumptions have you made about the data?

-	I have considered the multiple scores in a day as duplicates because there is either a mild change in the score or a sudden peak from the first and the last attempt.
-	I retained the recent score and removed the earlier instances from the data for analysis.
-	The sudden peaks and valleys of the score are typical.

## 3. What are 2-3 additional pieces of information that would be important to collect?

-	The specifics of the overall score is important to know the person's specific suffering. For example, "Worry", "Nervous".
-	Additional questions on avoidance behaviour to understand the impact of the problem. For instance, if they are missing   work, avoiding chores at home.
-	Age, Profession, Marital status to aid in analysing the root cause of the problem.
-	If they had been diagnosed with GAD or not
